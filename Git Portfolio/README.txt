Hello! Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio!

Within this portfolio, you will find 6 projects that I have worked on.

#Don't Ruin Game Night
The first project, the pdf file for DRGN Base Players Handbook, is a rulebook for the Tabletop RPG I created.
Within the rulebook are contained the basic rules of the game, a full character creation walkthrough, as well as steps for playing the game
and an equipment table. The highlight of this project is the "Abilities" section of character creation, which solves the problem of fireball
being bland if it only does fire damage and allows players to "build" their own abilities, potentially swapping the damage type of fireball to acid or ice
or even radiation.

The rest of these projects were designed within the Godot game engine. 
Viral Vanquish was programmed in Godot 4.1, and the rest were programmed in Godot 3.x

These project folders include sprites, scenes, and scripts. 
The scripts have the ".gd" suffix, if you're interested in looking at the code. The language used is GDScript, which is loosely based off of Python.
The more "game" design elements of the project, e.g. placing sprites in the world, level design, etc. are contained within the ".tscn" files.

#Goders TD
Goders TD is a tower defense game I worked on during the pandemic. I successfully designed and programmed 9 different towers for use within the game,
each of which can be upgraded, have its targeting modes switched, and have its elemental damage type switched. They can also have boosted attack speed, range,
damage, projectile speed, and be granted the ability to hit stealth or flying units.
The tower I am most proud of is the link tower, which is a special tower that, when placed within range of another link tower, creates a "network" of all 
other link towers within range. These towers sacrifice their own attacks to donate their attack power to a single "master" link node, which can change
based on the targeting priority of the network. Any node in the network can be used for targeting, but only one node actually shoots, and it combines the upgrades
and damage of all nodes in its network for a massive attack. The laser tower, Ramp tower, and Player tower are also interesting takes on common towers used 
in the tower defense genres.

#Viral Vanquish
Viral Vanquish is the current project I am working on. This game is designed to be a more strategic take on the tower defense genre. Rather than simply
waiting for the enemy to come to the player's "base," enemy viruses continually spawn from "factories," and players must push their defenses towards these
factories and shut them down in order to claim victory. The towers are all based off of elements from the periodic table (e.g. Hydrogen, Helium, etc.)
Each element has a primary effect and a secondary effect. When a tower is first placed, it uses the primary effect. Players can then "bond" any element
to an existing tower to give the tower the element's secondary effect.

#Godot Wild Game Jam Games
Within this folder, you will find 3 different game projects. All of these projects were given a time frame of 1 week.

#AssemblyRequired
The theme for this jam as "assembly required." I decided to make a factory simulation game, where players would place machines and attempt to process
raw materials into finished products as effeciently as possible. The machines would also perform their actions on a musical beat, giving the whole
factory an upbeat and perky feel. The game even included quantum entanglement and teleportation machines, allowing for crazy efficient creation
of products.

#Curses
This was the first game jam I did cooperatively with another person. The theme for the jam was "curses." We decided to create a more advanced
version of "bop it," in which the player would sit in a room and be given tasks, or "curses," that they had to satisfy to continue. These would
start easy, such as flicking a switch or turning a knob, but slowly advance until there were so many "curses" to satisfy the player would fail, and
receive a score based on the curses they managed to satisfy.

#Dream
This jam's theme was "Dream." I had just finished playing power washing simulator, and wanted to try my hand at creating a more satisfying than
entertaining game. The idea for this game is that during the day, the body gets injured and destroyed, and while you are dreaming, your body repairs
itself. In this game, you take control of the "body," and are responsible for fixing all of the different afflictions that the body accumulated 
throughout the day. You do this with an array of "brushes," which are designed to relax, repair, disinfect, or destroy parts of the body. Waving your mouse
cursor over the afflictions with the appropriate brush slowly repairs the damage done.

And that's my Portfolio! Thank you for taking the time to look over my work!
