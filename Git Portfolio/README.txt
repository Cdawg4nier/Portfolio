Hello! Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio!

Within this portfolio, you will find my favorite projects I have designed.

#Don't Ruin Game Night
The first project, the pdf file for DRGN Base Players Handbook, is a rulebook for the Tabletop RPG I created.
Within the rulebook are contained the basic rules of the game, a full character creation walkthrough, as well as steps for playing the game
and an equipment table. The highlight of this project is the "Abilities" section of character creation, which solves the problem of fireball
being bland if it only does fire damage and allows players to "build" their own abilities, potentially swapping the damage type of fireball to acid or ice
or even radiation.

#Goders TD
Goders TD is a tower defense game I worked on during the pandemic. I successfully designed and programmed 9 different towers for use within the game,
each of which can be upgraded, have its targeting modes switched, and have its elemental damage type switched. They can also have boosted attack speed, range,
damage, projectile speed, and be granted the ability to hit stealth or flying units.
The tower I am most proud of is the link tower, which is a special tower that, when placed within range of another link tower, creates a "network" of all 
other link towers within range. These towers sacrifice their own attacks to donate their attack power to a single "master" link node, which can change
based on the targeting priority of the network. Any node in the network can be used for targeting, but only one node actually shoots, and it combines the upgrades
and damage of all nodes in its network for a massive attack. The laser tower, Ramp tower, and Player tower are also interesting takes on common towers used 
in the tower defense genres.

This project folder includes sprites, scenes, and scripts. 
The scripts have the ".gd" suffix, if you're interested in looking at the code. The language used is GDScript, which is loosely based off of Python.
The more "game" design elements of the project, e.g. placing sprites in the world, level design, etc. are contained within the ".tscn" files.


#Project Mercenary
My most recent project, and the one I am the most proud of, is a deck-building card game all about hiring cool soldiers and "going nuclear," or playing your entire deck
every single round. It is a cooperative PvE game for 1-6 people, and includes 229 playing cards spread across 82 unique variants, with every card having a front and a
backside. The game also includes 12 "hero" cards, tokens for augmentation of cards and tracking of money, and HP trackers for both players and the "boss." Within this
project folder, you will find:
A picture showcasing all elements of the game laid out (showcase.webp)
A spreadsheet with every single card documented, both front and back (showcase.ods)
A simple rulebook detailing how to play and defining key terms (showcase.odt)
I am currently working with a design company to produce prototypes for the game. Feel free to email me at ca4nier@protonmail.com if you would like purchase a copy!


And that's my Portfolio! Thank you for taking the time to look over my work!
